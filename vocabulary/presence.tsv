term	definition
extant  IUCN: The species is known or thoughtvery likely to occur presently in the area, which encompasses localities with current or recent (last 20-30 years) records where suitable habitat at appropriate altitudes remains. Extant ranges are included in the calculation of extent of occurrence and in maps of the historical distribution  of the species.
possibly extant IUCN: There is no record of the species in the area, but the species may possibly occur, based on the distribution of potentially suitable habitat at appropriate altitudes, although the area is beyond where the species is Extant (i.e., beyond the limits of known or likely records), and the degree of probability of the species occurring is lower (e.g., because the area is beyond a geographic barrier, or because the area represents a considerable extension beyond areas of known or probably occurrence). Identifying Possibly Extant areas is useful to flag up areas where the taxon should be searched for. Possibly Extant ranges are not included in the calculation of extent of occurrence or in maps of the current and / or historical distribution of the taxon.
possibly extinct  IUCN: The species was formerly known or thought very likely to occur in the area (post 1500 AD), but it is most likely now extirpated from the area because habitat loss and/or other threats are thought likely to have extirpated the species, and there have been no confirmed recent records despite searches. Possibly Extinct ranges are not included in the calculation of extent of occurrence, but are included in maps of the historical distribution of the taxon.
extinct The species was formerly known or thought very likely to occur in the area, but it has been confirmed that the species no longer occurs because exhaustive searches have failed to produce recent records, and the intensity and timing of threats could plausibly have extirpated the taxon. Extinct ranges are not included in the calculation of extent of occurrence, but are included in maps of the historical distribution of the taxon.
extinct (post 1500) IUCN: The species was formerly known or thought very likely to occur in the area (post 1500 AD), but it has been confirmed that the species no longer occurs because exhaustive searches have failed to produce recent records, and the intensity and timing of threats could plausibly have extirpated the taxon. Extinct ranges are not included in the calculation of extent of occurrence, but are included in maps of the historical distribution of the taxon.
present DwC: There is at least one well documented record of the taxon's presence in the area.
presence uncertain  IUCN: A record exists of the species' presence in the area, but this record requires verification or is rendered questionable owing to uncertainty over the identity or authenticity of the record, or the accuracy of the location. Presence uncertain records are not included in the calculation of extent of occurrence or in maps of the historical distribution of the taxon
